### Try It Here: [Music Player](https://musicspinner.netlify.app)

This music player uses the Unsplash API and Spotify API to display songs with custom images that spin as the music play. The localStorage API is used to save every song and playlist created, so you don't need to worry about saving your songs. This website is a fast alternative to spotify music that requires no login and has a simple UI to avoid distractions.
